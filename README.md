# Bonzomatic

## What's this?
This is a live-coding tool, where you can write a 2D fragment/pixel shader while it is running in the background.

The tool was originally conceived and implemented after the Revision 2014 demoscene party's live coding competition where two contestants improv-code an effect in 25 minutes head-to-head: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5P9rRUXaR0

## Keys
- F5: recompile shader
- F11: hide shader overlay
- Alt-F4: exbobolate your planet

## Configuration
Create a ```config.json``` with e.g. the following contents: (all fields are optional)
``` javascript
{
  "font":{
    "file":"Input-Regular_(InputMono-Medium).ttf",
    "size":16,
  },
  "rendering":{
    "fftSmoothFactor": 0.9, // 0.0 means there's no smoothing at all, 1.0 means the FFT is completely smoothed flat
  },
  "textures":{ /* the keys below will become the shader variable names */
    "texChecker":"textures/checker.png",
    "texNoise":"textures/noise.png",
    "texTex1":"textures/tex1.jpg",
  },
  "gui":{
    "outputHeight": 200,
    "opacity": 192, // 255 means the editor occludes the effect completely, 0 means the editor is fully transparent
    "texturePreviewWidth": 64,
    "spacesForTabs": false,
    "tabSize": 8,
    "visibleWhitespace": true,
  },
  "midi":{ /* the keys below will become the shader variable names, the values are the CC numbers */
    "fMidiKnob": 16, /* e.g. this would be CC#16, i.e. by default the leftmost knob on a nanoKONTROL 2 */
  }
}
```

## Building
### Windows
Please use Visual C++ 2010 - nothing else is needed right now.

### OSX
Run the makefile inside the terminal application. You'll need the usual XCode command line developer tools.
If you have any questions about the OSX build please contact Oni (http://section9.co.uk)

Textures should be placeed inside Bonzomatic.app/Contents/MacOS, along with the config.json

## Future features / todo / etc.
- Option for tab sizes / spaces
