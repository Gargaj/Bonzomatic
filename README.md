## What's this?
This is a live-coding tool, where you can write a 2D fragment/pixel shader while it is running in the background.

The tool was originally conceived and implemented after the Revision 2014 demoscene party's live coding competition where two contestants improv-code an effect in 25 minutes head-to-head: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5P9rRUXaR0

## Keys
- F2: toggle texture preview
- F5 or Ctrl-R: recompile shader
- F11 or Ctrl/Cmd-f: hide shader overlay
- Alt-F4: exbobolate your planet

## Configuration
Create a ```config.json``` with e.g. the following contents: (all fields are optional)
``` javascript
{
  "window":{ /* default window size / state, if there's a setup dialog, it will override it */
    "width":1920,
    "height":1080,
    "fullscreen":true,
  },
  "font":{
    "file":"Input-Regular_(InputMono-Medium).ttf",
    "size":16,
  },
  "rendering":{
    "fftSmoothFactor": 0.9, // 0.0 means there's no smoothing at all, 1.0 means the FFT is completely smoothed flat
  },
  "textures":{ /* the keys below will become the shader variable names */
    "texChecker":"textures/checker.png",
    "texNoise":"textures/noise.png",
    "texTex1":"textures/tex1.jpg",
  },
  "gui":{
    "outputHeight": 200,
    "opacity": 192, // 255 means the editor occludes the effect completely, 0 means the editor is fully transparent
    "texturePreviewWidth": 64,
    "spacesForTabs": false,
    "tabSize": 8,
    "visibleWhitespace": true,
  },
  "midi":{ /* the keys below will become the shader variable names, the values are the CC numbers */
    "fMidiKnob": 16, /* e.g. this would be CC#16, i.e. by default the leftmost knob on a nanoKONTROL 2 */
  },
  /* this section is if you want to enable NDI streaming; otherwise just ignore it */
  "ndi":{
    "enabled": true,
    "connectionString": "<ndi_product something=\"123\"/>", /* metadata sent to the receiver; completely optional */
    "identifier": "hello!", /* additional string to the device name; helps source discovery/identification in the receiver if there are multiple sources on the network */
    "frameRate": 60.0, /* frames per second */
    "progressive": true, /* progressive or interleaved? */
  }
}
```

## Building
As you can see you're gonna need [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/) for this, but don't worry, a lot of it is automated at this point.
* On Windows, use at least Visual C++ 2010, or 2013 if your 2010 install doesn't have MFC. For the DX9/DX11 builds, obviously you'll be needing a DirectX SDK, though a lot of it is already in the Windows 8.1 SDK as well.
* On Linux, you'll need ```xorg-dev```; after that ```cmake``` should take care of the rest.
* On OSX, ```cmake``` should take care of everything.

## Organizing a competition
If you want to organize a competition using Bonzomatic at your party, here's a handy-dandy guide on how to get started:
