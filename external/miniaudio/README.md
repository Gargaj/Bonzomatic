miniaudio is a single file library for audio playback and capture. It's written in C (compilable as C++) and
released into the public domain.

Building
======
Do the following in one source file:
```c
#define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "miniaudio.h"
```
Then just compile. There's no need to install any dependencies. On Windows and macOS there's no need to link
to anything. On Linux just link to -lpthread, -lm and -ldl. On BSD just link to -lpthread and -lm. On iOS you
need to compile as Objective-C.


Simple Playback Example
=======================

```c
#define DR_FLAC_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../extras/dr_flac.h"  /* Enables FLAC decoding. */
#define DR_MP3_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../extras/dr_mp3.h"   /* Enables MP3 decoding. */
#define DR_WAV_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../extras/dr_wav.h"   /* Enables WAV decoding. */

#define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "../miniaudio.h"

#include <stdio.h>

void data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount)
{
    ma_decoder* pDecoder = (ma_decoder*)pDevice->pUserData;
    if (pDecoder == NULL) {
        return;
    }

    ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(pDecoder, pOutput, frameCount);

    (void)pInput;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    ma_result result;
    ma_decoder decoder;
    ma_device_config deviceConfig;
    ma_device device;

    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("No input file.\n");
        return -1;
    }

    result = ma_decoder_init_file(argv[1], NULL, &decoder);
    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
        return -2;
    }

    deviceConfig = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);
    deviceConfig.playback.format   = decoder.outputFormat;
    deviceConfig.playback.channels = decoder.outputChannels;
    deviceConfig.sampleRate        = decoder.outputSampleRate;
    deviceConfig.dataCallback      = data_callback;
    deviceConfig.pUserData         = &decoder;

    if (ma_device_init(NULL, &deviceConfig, &device) != MA_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Failed to open playback device.\n");
        ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);
        return -3;
    }

    if (ma_device_start(&device) != MA_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Failed to start playback device.\n");
        ma_device_uninit(&device);
        ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);
        return -4;
    }

    printf("Press Enter to quit...");
    getchar();

    ma_device_uninit(&device);
    ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);

    return 0;
}
```


MP3/Vorbis/FLAC/WAV Decoding
============================
miniaudio includes a decoding API which supports the following backends:
- FLAC via [dr_flac](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_flac.h)
- MP3 via [dr_mp3](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_mp3.h)
- WAV via [dr_wav](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_wav.h)
- Vorbis via [stb_vorbis](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c)

Copies of these libraries can be found in the "extras" folder.

To enable support for a decoding backend, all you need to do is #include the header section of the
relevant backend library before the implementation of miniaudio, like so:

```c
#include "dr_flac.h"    // Enables FLAC decoding.
#include "dr_mp3.h"     // Enables MP3 decoding.
#include "dr_wav.h"     // Enables WAV decoding.

#define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "miniaudio.h"
```

A decoder can be initialized from a file with `ma_decoder_init_file()`, a block of memory with
`ma_decoder_init_memory()`, or from data delivered via callbacks with `ma_decoder_init()`. Here
is an example for loading a decoder from a file:

```c
ma_decoder decoder;
ma_result result = ma_decoder_init_file("MySong.mp3", NULL, &decoder);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    return false;   // An error occurred.
}

...

ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);
```

When initializing a decoder, you can optionally pass in a pointer to a `ma_decoder_config` object
(the `NULL` argument in the example above) which allows you to configure the output format, channel
count, sample rate and channel map:

```c
ma_decoder_config config = ma_decoder_config_init(ma_format_f32, 2, 48000);
```

When passing in NULL for this parameter, the output format will be the same as that defined by the
decoding backend.

Data is read from the decoder as PCM frames:

```c
ma_uint64 framesRead = ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(pDecoder, pFrames, framesToRead);
```

You can also seek to a specific frame like so:

```c
ma_result result = ma_decoder_seek_to_pcm_frame(pDecoder, targetFrame);
if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {
    return false;   // An error occurred.
}
```

When loading a decoder, miniaudio uses a trial and error technique to find the appropriate decoding
backend. This can be unnecessarily inefficient if the type is already known. In this case you can
use the `_wav`, `_mp3`, etc. varients of the aforementioned initialization APIs:

```
ma_decoder_init_wav()
ma_decoder_init_mp3()
ma_decoder_init_memory_wav()
ma_decoder_init_memory_mp3()
ma_decoder_init_file_wav()
ma_decoder_init_file_mp3()
etc.
```

The `ma_decoder_init_file()` API will try using the file extension to determine which decoding
backend to prefer.
